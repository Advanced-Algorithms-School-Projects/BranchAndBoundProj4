The goal of this project was to implement a branch and bound algorithm for
solving the knapsack problem. The bound portion of the algorithm worked by
firstly calculating the known cost for a particular branch, then adding the
cost ratio of the next best option multiplied by the remaining cost. The
algorithm also implemented a depth first approach, which was useful because
it could more quickly identify possible solutions, and fathoming could occur
more quickly. The disadvantage  of this algorithm is that its worst-case run
time is exponential, however, often the algorithm will not run in exponential
time because many instances of the problem will experience significant fathoming.
Many instances appeared to run rather quickly. Another advantage to this algorithm 
is that it will always obtain the optimal solution. As such, it should always
be used over the exhaustive algorithm.
